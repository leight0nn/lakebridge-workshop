/*
GlobalSupply Corp - Transpiled SQL Validation Tests
==================================================

This script provides comprehensive validation tests for the 5 transpiled SQL files
from Module 1's Wave 1 & 2 (Simple and Medium complexity). These tests ensure
that the Databricks SQL versions produce equivalent results to the original
SQL Server queries.

Target Files Being Validated:
- financial_summary_databricks.sql (4.5/10) - Basic aggregation, reporting
- order_processing_databricks.sql (5.1/10) - CRUD operations, transactions
- dynamic_reporting_databricks.sql (6.5/10) - Dynamic SQL, conditional logic
- window_functions_analysis_databricks.sql (7.2/10) - Advanced window functions
- customer_profitability_databricks.sql (7.8/10) - PIVOT operations, analytics

Business Purpose:
Provide confidence that the transpiled code produces accurate results and is
ready for production deployment. These tests should be run in both development
and staging environments before go-live.

Prerequisites:
- Unity Catalog schema created (02_databricks_schema.sql executed)
- Sample data loaded into raw tables
- Transpiled SQL files deployed and accessible

/*
VALIDATION TEST COMPLETION CHECKLIST:
=====================================

EXECUTION STEPS:
[ ] 1. Ensure Unity Catalog schema is created (02_databricks_schema.sql)
[ ] 2. Load sample data if available
[ ] 3. Deploy transpiled SQL files
[ ] 4. Execute this validation script
[ ] 5. Review test results and fix any failures
[ ] 6. Re-run tests until all pass
[ ] 7. Document validation results

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
- PASS: Test completed successfully, no issues
- WARNING: Test completed but with concerns (review needed)
- FAIL: Test failed, must fix before deployment
- INFO/SKIPPED: Informational or skipped tests

NEXT STEPS BASED ON RESULTS:
- All Pass → Proceed to Module 3: Data Reconciliation
- Some Warnings → Review and document, may proceed with caution
- Any Failures → Fix transpilation issues and re-test

COMMON FAILURE CAUSES:
1. Missing sample data → Load test data or adjust tests
2. Syntax errors → Review transpiled SQL files
3. Function differences → Check conversion patterns
4. Schema mismatches → Verify Unity Catalog setup
5. Performance issues → Optimize queries or adjust thresholds

For production deployment, consider adding:
- Data volume tests with realistic datasets
- Concurrent user testing
- Performance benchmarking against original SQL Server
- Business user acceptance testing
- Rollback procedure validation
