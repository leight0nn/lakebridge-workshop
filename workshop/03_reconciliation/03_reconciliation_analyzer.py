GlobalSupply Corp - Data Reconciliation using Lakebridge Reconcile

This script demonstrates comprehensive data validation between source systems 
and Databricks targets using Lakebridge Reconcile capabilities. Following Module 2's
successful transpilation, this validates data integrity for production cutover.

Business Context:
GlobalSupply Corp has transpiled SQL Server workloads to Databricks and now requires
99%+ accuracy validation before production cutover. This reconciliation phase is 
mission-critical for business continuity and stakeholder confidence.

Usage:
    python 03_reconciliation_analyzer.py [--mode live|simulated] [--config config.yaml]

Prerequisites:
    - Databricks CLI installed and configured
    - Lakebridge installed: databricks labs install lakebridge
    - Python dependencies: pip install pandas sqlalchemy databricks-sql-connector
    - Module 1 & 2 completion (assessment and transpilation outputs)

Features:
    - Live mode: Connect to actual SQL Server for real-time validation
    - Simulated mode: Use mock data for self-contained learning
    - Comprehensive reconciliation reports with executive summaries
    - Row-count, schema, and value-level validation
    - Data drift detection and discrepancy analysis
