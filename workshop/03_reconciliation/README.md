# Module 3: Data Reconciliation & Validation

## 📊 Business Context: GlobalSupply Corp Migration Phase 3

Following the successful completion of **Module 1** (assessment) and **Module 2** (transpilation), **GlobalSupply Corp** now enters the critical **data validation phase** of their SQL Server to Databricks migration. With transpiled SQL code in hand, the focus shifts to ensuring **data integrity** and **business continuity** through comprehensive reconciliation.

### 🎯 Mission-Critical Objectives

**Data reconciliation is the make-or-break phase** where theoretical migrations meet real-world business requirements. GlobalSupply Corp's executive team has mandated **99%+ accuracy validation** before any production cutover.

## 🏗️ Module Overview

This module demonstrates **Lakebridge Reconciliation** capabilities for validating data consistency between source systems and Databricks targets. You'll learn to:

- Configure automated reconciliation pipelines
- Execute row-level and aggregate data comparisons  
- Generate executive-ready validation reports
- Troubleshoot and resolve data discrepancies
- Establish ongoing monitoring for data drift

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Components
- **Databricks workspace** with Unity Catalog enabled
- **Lakebridge installed**: `databricks labs install lakebridge`
- **Python dependencies**: `pip install pandas sqlalchemy databricks-sql-connector`
- **Module 1 & 2 completion** (assessment and transpilation outputs)

### Optional Components
- **Source SQL Server access** (for live reconciliation)
- **Sample datasets** (provided for simulated mode)

---

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

By completing this module, you will:

1. **Configure Reconciliation**: Set up source and target connections with proper security
2. **Design Validation Rules**: Create comprehensive data quality checks and business rules
3. **Execute Comparisons**: Run row-count, schema, and value-level validations
4. **Analyze Discrepancies**: Investigate and categorize data differences
5. **Generate Reports**: Create stakeholder-ready validation documentation
6. **Establish Monitoring**: Implement ongoing data drift detection

---

## 🛤️ Two Learning Paths

### Path A: Live Mode (Recommended for Production-Ready Skills)
- Connect to actual SQL Server source system
- Perform real-time data reconciliation
- Experience production-grade challenges
- Generate authentic validation reports

### Path B: Simulated Mode (Self-Contained Learning)
- Use provided mock source data (SQLite database)
- Follow guided reconciliation scenarios
- Learn concepts without external dependencies
- Focus on methodology and tooling

---

## 📈 Expected Business Outcomes

### Technical Validation
- **99%+ data accuracy** confirmed across all migrated tables
- **Zero critical business logic errors** in reconciliation reports
- **Sub-second performance** for standard validation queries
- **Comprehensive audit trail** for compliance requirements

### Business Impact
- **Risk mitigation**: Confidence in data integrity before production cutover
- **Stakeholder trust**: Executive-ready validation documentation
- **Cost avoidance**: Early detection prevents post-migration data issues
- **Operational readiness**: Proven reconciliation processes for ongoing monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Live Mode
```bash
# Configure source connection
cp config/sample_reconciliation_config.yaml config/reconciliation_config.yaml
# Edit config with your SQL Server connection details

# Run reconciliation
python 03_reconciliation_analyzer.py --mode live --config config/reconciliation_config.yaml
```

### Option 2: Simulated Mode
```bash
# Generate mock source data
cd mock_data && python generate_mock_source.py

# Run simulated reconciliation
python 03_reconciliation_analyzer.py --mode simulated
```

## 💡 Success Criteria

**Module completion is confirmed when you can demonstrate:**
- ✅ Successful reconciliation configuration
- ✅ Clean execution of all validation tests
- ✅ 99%+ accuracy metrics across test datasets
- ✅ Generated reconciliation report with executive summary
- ✅ Understanding of discrepancy investigation workflows
